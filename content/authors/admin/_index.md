I am a postdoctoral fellow at KITE Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, University Health Network, under the supervision of Dr. Cathy Craven who is a senior scientist at TRI and a professor at the University of Toronto. 

Our main research and quality improvement activities focus on two projects: [The Spinal Cord Injury Implementation, Evaluation, and Quality Care Consortium](https://www.sciconsortium.ca/) [](https://www.sciconsortium.ca/)and Cardiometabolic Care. My main inputs to these projects are:

* Conduct economic evaluation of a novel interprofessional rehabilitation practice for patients with spinal cord injury
* Develop guidelines for conducting systematic reviews in the field of spinal cord injury
* Develop interactive visual analytics using R Shiny and Power BI
* Conduct statistical analyses of the quality of health care data and co-author reports to the Ministry
* Develop, maintain, and manage the database of collected data from six domains and the NRS dataset
