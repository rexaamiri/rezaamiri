  Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has created an opportunity for multiple
  rehabilitation science learners and clinicians to critically evaluate and
  synthesize published research in the field of spinal cord injury (SCI)
  rehabilitation.


  Objective: To provide a step-by-step guide for rehabilitation science learners and clinicians outlining how to conduct rigorous systematic reviews in the field of SCI.


  Results: Steps for conducting a systematic review (SR) include: (1) formation of the SR team consisting of interprofessional experts; (2) formulation of the research question(s) with patient/population/problem, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome (PICO) specification; (3) determination of inclusion and exclusion criteria; (4) development of SR protocol and registration; (5) development of the search strategies (database-specific); (6) screening of titles and abstracts (level 1 screening), and full-texts (level 2 screening); (7) quality assessment of the included studies; (8) data extraction; (9) summary of findings and discussion; and, (10) dissemination of results.


  Conclusions: The enclosed ten steps for conducting SRs in SCI rehabilitation research have the potential to significantly improve the quality of evidence synthesis and the associated inferences. The importance of assembling a team with diverse expertise is emphasized to assure a quality product with the potential to influence practice and inform the content of clinical practice recommendations.
