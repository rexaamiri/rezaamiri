abstract: After concussion, a subset of patients have persistent symptoms that
  are functionally limiting and may be difficult to treat. These symptoms were
  previously captured in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
  Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) under the diagnosis of "Post-Concussion
  Syndrome." However, in the recently published fifth edition of the Diagnostic
  and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, postconcussion syndrome has been
  eliminated. The elimination of "Post-Concussion Syndrome" moves the Diagnostic
  and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders further away from congruence with
  the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) with respect to the
  classification of postconcussion symptomology. Although this change likely had
  the positive effect of reducing misdiagnoses of symptoms due to other causes,
  the authors highlight the potential issues surrounding the elimination of
  postconcussion syndrome in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
  Disorders, Fifth Edition. This opinion piece also emphasizes the multiple
  diagnostic and therapeutic challenges that may result for those involved in
  the treatment of, or research regarding, concussion patients with persistent
  symptoms. Future revisions that provide clear clinical diagnostic criteria may
  be beneficial.
