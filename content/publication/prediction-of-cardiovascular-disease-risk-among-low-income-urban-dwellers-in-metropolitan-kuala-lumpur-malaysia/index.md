abstract: We aimed to predict the ten-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk
  among low-income urban dwellers of metropolitan Malaysia. Participants were
  selected from a cross-sectional survey conducted in Kuala Lumpur. To assess
  the 10-year CVD risk, we employed the Framingham risk scoring (FRS) models.
  Significant determinants of the ten-year CVD risk were identified using
  General Linear Model (GLM). Altogether 882 adults (â‰¥30 years old with no CVD
  history) were randomly selected. The classic FRS model (figures in parentheses
  are from the modified model) revealed that 20.5% (21.8%) and 38.46% (38.9%) of
  respondents were at high and moderate risk of CVD. The GLM models identified
  the importance of education, occupation, and marital status in predicting the
  future CVD risk. Our study indicated that one out of five low-income urban
  dwellers has high chance of having CVD within ten years. Health care
  expenditure, other illness related costs and loss of productivity due to CVD
  would worsen the current situation of low-income urban population. As such,
  the public health professionals and policy makers should establish substantial
  effort to formulate the public health policy and community-based intervention
  to minimize the upcoming possible high mortality and morbidity due to CVD
  among the low-income urban dwellers.
