abstract: "In recent years, there has been a shift away from rest until total
  symptom resolution after concussion, due to the potential adverse consequences
  of inactivity. Aerobic exercise has been increasingly investigated for the
  treatment of postconcussion syndrome, whereby symptoms persist beyond 4 wks.
  The aim of this review was to systematically review the literature on
  subsymptom threshold aerobic exercise as a treatment for postconcussion
  syndrome. We conducted systematic literature searches in databases: MEDLINE
  (Ovid), CINAHL, PubMed, and Embase. After thorough review, 12 articles met the
  eligibility criteria and were included in the systematic review. The quality
  of selected studies was low to moderate. Subsymptom threshold aerobic exercise
  was associated with improvement in symptoms in patients with postconcussion
  syndrome for all included studies. The most commonly used protocols
  incorporated 20 mins of exercise at 80% of the heart rate that provoked
  symptoms, 5-6 days per week, with no adverse events documented. However, there
  was considerable variation in exercise protocols, and many studies
  incorporated subsymptom threshold aerobic exercise as part of a broader
  rehabilitation plan. Evidence supports subsymptom threshold aerobic exercise
  as a promising treatment for postconcussion syndrome. Further studies are
  required to delineate the optimal intensity, duration, and frequency of
  exercise for postconcussion syndrome in a variety of populations."
