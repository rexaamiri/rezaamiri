abstract: Central sensitization is a condition that represents a cascade of
  neurological adaptations, resulting in an amplification of nociceptive
  responses from noxious and non-noxious stimuli. However, whether this
  abnormality translates into motor output and more specifically, ventral horn
  abnormalities, needs to be further explored. Twenty healthy participants aged
  20-70 were randomly allocated to topical capsaicin or a placebo topical cream
  which was applied onto their left upper back to induce a transient state of
  sensitization. Visual analogue scale (VAS) ratings of pain intensity and brush
  allodynia score (BAS) were used to determine the presence of pain and
  secondary allodynia. Surface electromyography (sEMG) and intramuscular
  electromyography (iEMG) were used to record motor unit activity from the upper
  trapezius and infraspinatus muscles before and twenty minutes after
  application of capsaicin/placebo. Motor unit recruitment and variability were
  analyzed in the sEMG and iEMG, respectively. An independent t-test and
  Kruskal-Wallis H test were performed on the data. The sEMG results
  demonstrated a shift in the motor unit recruitment pattern in the upper
  trapezius muscle, while the iEMG showed a change in motor unit variability
  after application of capsaicin. These results suggest that capsaicin-induced
  central sensitization may cause changes in ventral horn excitability outside
  of the targeted spinal cord segment, affecting efferent pathway outputs. This
  preclinical evidence may provide some explanation for the influence of central
  sensitization on changes in movement patterns that occur in patients who have
  pain encouraging of further clinical investigation.
