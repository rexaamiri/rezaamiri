abstract: Insufficient physical activity and growing obesity levels among
  Malaysian adolescents are becoming a public health concern. Our study is to
  identify the trends of self-reported physical activity (PA) levels, blood
  lipid profiles, and body composition (BC) indices from a cohort of 820
  adolescents. The self-reported PA was assessed using a validated Malay version
  of the PA Questionnaire for Older Children (PAQ-C). Fasting blood samples were
  collected to investigate their lipid profiles. Height, weight, waist and hip
  circumferences as well as body fat percentage were measured. The baseline and
  the first follow-up were conducted in 2012 and 2014, respectively. A downward
  trend in the PA level was seen in all categories with a significant reduction
  among all rural adolescents (P = 0.013) and more specifically, PA among girls
  residing in rural areas dropped significantly (P = 0.006). Either a
  significant reduction in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) or a significant
  increment in BC indices (i.e., body mass index [BMI], waist circumference
  [WC], hip circumference, and body fat percentage [BF %]) were seen in this
  group. Female adolescents experienced more body fat increment with the
  reduction of physical activity. If not intervened early, adolescents from
  rural areas may increase their risk of developing cardiovascular diseases
  earlier.
